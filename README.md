LudoTempo
========================

Introduction
-----------

LudoTempo, which is Esperanto for GameTime, is a simple tool for scheduling and managing the event aspects of game hosting and game playing. It is targeted at people who like to host games (usually meaning in-person, but online can work as well) and/or play games. 

The main problems it is designed to solve are those of finding games to play and players who want to play (the what and the who), and coordinating game session attendance (the when and the where).

Consider for a moment what other services exist that have been put to similar use. For instance, let's say you want to join an existing group of players who are engaged in a particular tabletop game. How do you go about finding a group that a) is playing the game you want to play, b) is playing in a location you can reach comfortably, and c) is open to new players? The current state of the art is the constellation of forums, gamer classifieds, and even a few services that look like they might approach this problem by listing gamers in your area.

Let's use Reddit as our baseline. As a gamer looking for a game, or a host looking for players, your options are either to search or post in /r/lfg or something like it, which is to say a global subreddit with a good deal of traffic; or to find the closest thing you have to a localized subreddit in the hopes of catching interested parties on days when they are actually looking at the subreddit. The rest of the arrangement process, assuming any kind of match occurred, shuffles off to email, that ever-dying king of social networks.

What if the players you're looking for don't use the forums you're using?

What if they do use the forums you're using, but not regularly enough to catch your post looking for them?

Another option is the small collection of websites that get closer to the problem, in that they allow people to signal to one another that they are interested in particular games. These have potential, but a major shortcoming I have noticed with them is that they lack any sense of the temporal. It is not enough to find someone who plays the same game you play. You want to know if they are still playing, if they are interested in playing at the present time, if they even still live in the location where you found them, and whether they have room in their schedule to play when you have room in your schedule to play.

In short, they fail to close the circuit.

That's where LudoTempo comes in.

Planned Features
-----------
1. Anyone can search for hosts and players, filtering by games, locations, availability, and recency of activity.
2. Registered users can signal the games they want to host and/or play, as well as their general days and times of availability. 
3. Registered hosts can schedule specific session times which other registered users may sign up to attend. Sessions can be open (accepting new players) or closed (accepting only a pre-defined group), public or private, and can include an optional RSVP cutoff to help hosts communicate with players on the status of the session.
4. Those signed up for a session can opt to receive event reminders and add sessions to their electronic calendars.
5. Users will always remain in control of the groups they join as hosts and players, so they can filter out games and/or groups that include hosts and/or players they have placed in their block list.

Sound easy? As I said, it's a simple tool, but the devil is in the details. Stay tuned. In the meantime, if you would like to contribute, see below.
